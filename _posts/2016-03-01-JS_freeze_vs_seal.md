## The purpose

Sometime we take long years developing with a programming language but we do not know the basic things.

## Reason

working with a partner I found we both did not know what we could do with Object.freeze so I just decided go coding a basic example to share with other developers.

## About the project

Project is basically a mocha test that will show us the difference between **Object.freeze** and **Object.seal**


## Code
